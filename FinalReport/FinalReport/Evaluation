Final Report Project, CS87 Spring 2020

Overall
=======

A very impressive project!  

The report includes good coverage.  However, it is a bit difficult to read in
spots.  Adding more figures to help explain, and some re-organization may help.  
Add more figure to your presentation.

There are future directions for your work that look interesting. 


Details
=======
----------------
1. Does the abstract summarize the problem, the solution, and
   summarize experimental questions and results?
----------------

yes

* the what and results well stated
* briefly define/say what dedupication is
* you motivation sentence could be clearer: it is a bit confusing
  (it is much clearer in your intro)


----------------
2. Does the paper introduce the key issues, the key ideas of
  the solution or breadth and depth of topic, the goals of the project, discuss
  related work and use proper citation?
----------------


intro is good, but could be expanded with a bit more detail and 
explaination of what you mean by deduplication and why you expect
it to perform well (what are the big outcomes that you expect from
such a DFS?)

related coverage is good, but the organization is hard to follow, and
some information for understanding is missing

minor comments:

* Explain why for this: "traditional deduplication methods that rely solely 
 on the unique hash value of a file or data block are susceptible to data 
 corruption due to hash collision." 
* it is not that you are designing a new deduplicated DFS, it is that you
  are designing a new DFS with deduplication support.
* use present tense
* start related with (or before related cover) chunk-based deduplication (you 
  compare other work to it, but it isn't described)
* Say what HBase is



----------------
3. Does the paper clearly present the parallel or distributed 
  solution or system?  Are figures effectively used to help describe this?
4. Is the system/solution well explained.
----------------

There is a lot good in here.  At a high-level the topic coverage is complete.
However, some parts could use a bit more explaination to help the reader
understand how your system works.   I actually wonder if just some 
reorganization would help with this.  

Figures of your system (like Figure 2 should come earlier), and a figure
that illustrates how your deduplication works with an example  would be
very good to add (this is your big idea!).  The R&W operations in 4. could 
use an additional figure.

* 3.1: Add a figure of your system! (like figure 2 earlier)  
* 3.1 describe your opertions a bit more: are R and W only sequential R and W 
  of whole (or part) of file?  Is W once or append or ...? 
  You go into detail in 4. but a bit more is needed when first introduce.
* to figure 1 (which is good) add a bit more description in the prose and
  caption about what it is showing, label each part as the BlockMap and
  the GroupMap
* 3.5: this is the key part of your system.  Even more explaination and 
  a figure of who is doing what part would be good here (trace through the
  details of how your system does a block W for a duplicate and 
  for a non-duplicate block). 
* 4: the details about the operations are good.  A figure would be nice
  for W and R, which are the most interesting for your system
  (W in particular).

minor comments:

* "Files are organized into directories to increase access time" ?
* there is a bit of klunky writing in here that makes some parts hard to follow

--------------
5. Are the experiments clearly described, well designed, and the 
  results clearly presented?  Are the significance of the results discussed 
  and analyzed?  
----------------

Nice results.  They are a bit hard to follow.  If you use descriptive names 
for the experiments, and short reminders in prose as you discuss them, this 
will help a great deal (the reader forgets what the first, second, and 
third experiments are).  It will also help in your explaination of the results 
and what they show.  

* table 1 caption: say what the ratio is: of what to what?
* In graphs use descriptive names for and labels (vs. exp X) for the 
  three experiements.  

----------------
6. Is there a complete conclusion?  Are future directions to this
  work presented/discussed?
----------------

yes

----------------
7. Does the scope of the project and the completed report represent 
   a half semester worth of work?
----------------

yes.  definitely.  nice project!
