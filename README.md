CS87 Course project repo 

I've added four subdirectories for you, three are for reports related to your 
project, and a fourth for project source.  You should not remove these
four subdirectories, but you should feel free to add additional content 
to this repo (more directories, etc.) as you find useful for your project.

The document starting points are organized for the original project.
The remote class versions of project reports will differ some.
